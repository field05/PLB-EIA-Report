EIA report for Jelutong Landfill Rehabilitation and Reclamation (from landfill till Amway, in front of Karpal Singh Drive)

In line with our commitment to environmental transparency and community empowerment—and to guard against “link rot” that can undermine public trust—the complete EIA report for the Proposed Landfill Rehabilitation and Reclamation Works at Seksyen 8, Bandar Jelutong has been archived and mirrored on GitHub. Although Jabatan Alam Sekitar first announced the report on Facebook (with a Google Drive download link) on 12 February 2025, that link had become unreachable by 6 May 2025. By hosting the report in a dedicated, version-controlled repository (https://github.com/field05/PLB-EIA-Report), we ensure that researchers, NGOs, resident groups, and all stakeholders can reliably access, download, cite, and even flag issues or propose corrections—fostering a truly participatory review process.
